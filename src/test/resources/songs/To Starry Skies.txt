Do you recall the song we wrote once long ago?
Whose words so sweetly cut me into me and you
So why don't we TRY and FLY once again?

The long forgotten song
Is useless magic
You shall return
To the Ballad of the Crystal Ponies

All found with love rises through
QUATERNITY until the love has CRYSTAL clarity
My faith in love is ABSOLUTE for love is ALL there was
So what was FOUND without the love has LEFT without a cause

Everything is there to see
It always was and will be
So lift your WINGS to starry skies
As we fly, as we FLY, SO FAR AWAY!!!!
