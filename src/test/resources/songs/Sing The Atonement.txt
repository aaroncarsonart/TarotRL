As I see you
And you see me
And we fly into eternity

There's only one song that WE can sing
So let me HEAR your HARMONY

You'll know the words before you try
So, DON'T you look away from me
Just open your eyes for all to see
And then I'll know your NAME to be

SING THE ATONEMENT
AS LOUD AS YOU CAN
SING THE ATONEMENT
AS LOUD AS YOU CAN

DON'T PUSH YOURSELF TOO HARD NOW
OR YOU MAY FORGET
THAT ALL YOU NEED TO IS SING
YOUR TRUTH'S ALPHABET, OOH!!!!

My words may sound all to simple
How could I allow this to be
To again TRUST in every SYMBOL
When TERRIBLE things I still SEE

But NOW I will tell you a SECRET
There's only ONE thing YOU must know
A truth so simple and SACRED
YOU NEVER CAN LET THIS ONE GO

THERE'S ONLY ONE SONG YOU CAN EVER SING
IT'S THE TRUTH WITHIN YOUR HEART
So don't YOU ever DARE NOT to let it RING
Or you'll TEAR YOURSELF APART

For only one love can BETRAY you
And only ONE can set you FREE
And when you HEAR it you'll share it with OTHERS
TILL ALL DANCE IN PURE X STAY C

For we are all one, FOR WE ALL ARE ONE
FOR WE ARE AT ONE, for we are at one

And our SONG is the ATONEMENT
That WE are FOREVER FREE
Where INNOCENCE SHINES ETERNAL
To FEED creativity

As we each grow this MAGNIFICENT tree of harmony
Where every BRANCH and LEAF that grows is made of YOU and ME

So lift your voices and shout it aloud, and SING your TRUTH to ME
So LIFT our VOICES and SHOUT it ALOUD, and SING your TRUTH to ME
So LIFT all VOICES to BEHOLD the SHROUD, and SPEAK your TRUTHS to ME
S0 SPEAK your TRUTH within EVERY heart, and YOU'LL know THAT it's ME
