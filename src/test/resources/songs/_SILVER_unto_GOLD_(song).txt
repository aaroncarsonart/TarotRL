Presented with choices
WE both wear the CROWN.
WE HEAR our voices
Expressing what's FOUND.

A mystery to some,
But ELLINELLE sings SILVER
Protecting HEARTS from
What a KLYSS kiss delivers

THE WHY IS REAL
DAMAGE UN-REAL
GUILT IS SHOWN
INNOCENCE KNOWN

LOVE DA-MAGES
SO LOVE DA-MAGES
LOVE DA-MAGES
SO LOVE DA-MAGES

Presented with choices
WE both wear the CROWN.
WE HEAR our voices
Expressing what's FOUND.

A mystery to some,
But ELLINELLE sings SILVER
Protecting HEARTS from
What a KLYSS kiss delivers

TO THE FORMLESS, ALL RETURNS
DAMAGE NOT RECEIVED
THE RINGING WON'T HEAL
UNTIL YOUR FACE IS REVEALED

LOVE DA-MAGES
SO LOVE DA-MAGES
LOVE DA-MAGES
SO LOVE DA-MAGES

NOW, FACE THE CONCEIVED!!!!
NOW, FACE THE CONCEIVED!!!!
NOW, FACE THE CONCEIVED!!!!
NOW, FACE THE CONCEIVED!!!!
