you better watch out 'cause I'm back
y'all tried to stop me, but now that I'm back on track
ya best brace yourself for attack
cause I'm singing songs of friendship and harmony
oh, oh, oh, OH!!!!

it's not like I had a choice
this world nearly broke me, 'cause many times I paid the price
of daring to resist love's advice
so thank you for the lessons you've taught me
oh, oh, oh, OH!!!!

if the wind tries to SWAY you
PLEASE OBEY
otherwise your branches may start to crack
AND FALL AWAY

so come on now, and and work together with me
it doesn't matter if we choose friendship or cruelty

'cause we all know that my anger can summon dear Justin
and we all know how that game ENDS!!!

so when you hear that the horses are comin'
that's how you'll know we're FRIENDS!!!
