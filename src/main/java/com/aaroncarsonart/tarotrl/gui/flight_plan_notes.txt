What do I want to accomplish?
-----------------------------

Design a VERY SIMPLE game idea that has an objective and is completable.

You move an @ around a grid.  Collect keys, open doors, collect treasure from chests, without running out of energy or health.  Monsters will obstruct your progress and try to hurt you.

For run 1
---------

Each collision is one Hit to each party.  Monsters take 1 hit and die.  A hero can take up to 5 hits.


General game flow
-----------------
A game loop will do the following, in no particular order:

1. draw game state
2. request player input
3. update game state
