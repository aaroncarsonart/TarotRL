ATTENTION:

This is a code snippet from a new project I’m working on. Well, it was an old project I’ve hosted on my GitHub, but I had to put it down for some time as things were becoming too complicated and I stopped feeling capable of following the initial purpose to continue.  But now I have found a new direction, and am again developing this project: TarotRL.

https://github.com/aaroncarsonart/TarotRL

Please review the attached ```~z\K/z~``` snippet and provide any suggestions or recommendations.  Also, do feel FREE to submit pull requests to the repository.  I will consider integration of any such recommended changes.

	calculate_direction_of_wind_damage(s);

```c++
// ---------------------
// directing WIND damage
// ---------------------
const int ONE = 1;
const int *wind_e_RE_direction = *ONE;

int const wind_damage = 1;
char** windigo_psychosis = "[`]"
int windia_damage_index = wind_damage;

// TODO: integrate with array of strings matching contents of: ```s="Wyndia, Winlan, Windia”```.

// AUTHOR'S NOTE: avoid use of MAGIC numbers
char take_and_receive = windigo_psychosis[1];
// ---------------------
```
Your attention is valuable and appreciated.  Thank ```~\ YOU /~``` for reading this.
