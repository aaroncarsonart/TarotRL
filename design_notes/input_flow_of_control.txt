Q. How do UI component mouse events get processed?

Consider a online screen menu, which can be navigatable
by both the mouse and the keyboard.

You can simultaneously:
1. use arrow keys, enter, and escape keys
2. use the mouse

To navigate menus.  How do each of these actions get handled?
The menu must have a spacial component, and logical components.
Basically, they are a special map interface :-D

You will have regions you can teleport between.  Each is a
special menu grid.
- Using the arrow keys allows the user to navigate
  between each option of the current menu, based on
  each menu item's relative positions on the screen.
  The currently selected menu item will be displayed
  with either a cursor like '@" or ">" etc, or a
  highlighted effect. (Different fg/bg colors).

- Pressing enter navigates to a sub menu.
- Pressing escape returns to the previous menu.

Why do I reinvent the wheel every time?
... because I can, and it is kinda fun.

GameModes
---------


What needs to happen when a user input command requests a change in a GameMode?

1. The GameMode needs updation in the GameState.
2. The current update step is sidestepped.
3. The input is re-ran through ... ugh I need to take a break and rethink this ... AGAIN.
