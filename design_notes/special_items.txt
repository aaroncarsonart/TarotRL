Some items enable new menu options or game functionality by having them.

This can be done either with `onAddToInventory(Callback)` and `onRemoveFromInventory(Callback)`
setting a flag in the GameState, or with the GameState maintaining a special collection of
`Map<GameFlag, Supplier<Boolean>> flags`` where one an entry could be
`inventory.stream().anyMatch(Predicate<Item>)` or something similar to check for the condition.

- If you pick up an Amulet of Monster Knowledge, the "Bestiary" tab
  will be available, and you can see info on all the monsters you
  have slain. (Stats, number encountered, etc.)

  you can write notes in said book or on said paper.

- Owning any Tarot Cards unlocks the TAROT_CARD game mode.

Some items must be used to enable an effect with a specified duration.
- Torches, Lanterns, and Light spells will illuminate darkened spaces
  around the entity in a given pattern.

  (When line of sight is implemented, sight is reduced to the entity's
  night vision settings (usually a range of one tile) around the entity,
  and any areas that are lit and within sight.
