Who wants to play this game?
----------------------------

The strange intersection of two niche markets:
- People with an interest, or familiarity, with the Tarot.
- People who like Roguelikes, and text-based ASCII games.



What kind of experience will players receive from participating?
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Personal growth
- Exploration of how ideas and symbols interrelate
- Learning about the symbolism of the Tarot concepts
- Deepening understanding by linking elements with components of gameplay



What behaviors are players encouraged to engage in?
---------------------------------------------------
- Exploring unknown territory (and ideas).
- Planning to ensure they can sustain themselves on the journey.
- Introspection



What gameplay elements do I desire to include?
----------------------------------------------
- Explore random, procedurally generated levels.
- Develop and maintain a home.
- Cultivate crops.
- Manage an Inventory of items.
- Collect resources like wood, stone.
- Develop relationships with NPCs you encounter.
- Use Tarot cards, in which spreads will effect later
  events in the game or not, based on your faith in
  the cards.
- Discover/find the Tarot cards first?
  Or, have them already?
- Possible win condition: complete the "The Fool's Journey"
  (Traverse a series of maps based on each of the Major Arcana)
- Have personal health resources:
  - Energy: capacity to take action, and health.  For fun and
            simplicity, make it all one stat, to see what happens
            when your ability to take a step or swing a tool is
            also related to your ability to survive combat.
            In game explanation: at the beginning, the game
            asserts that "All is energy, all is vibration.  And
            what is this energy?  It is nothing else but love.
            What is the meaning of love?  This is beyond what
            can be explained, or taught.  But it can be understood
            by learning all that love is not."  And thus, the
            player is only one thing, and is encouraged to under-
            stand themselves as a self-concept as love itself,
            which is also the force that grows and extends the
            lands, allows for all characters to be, and so on.
    Time: passage of in-game time effects some game components.
          With time, some components will evolve or change.
- The Elements Of Harmony:
  The Mane 6 will be hidden within the game.  Somehow related to certain
  colors or keywords, little breadcrumbs to their existence and what they
  represent will be hidden throughout the game, which represent 5 super
  secret hidden levels, where each Element is then earned.
  (Which will relate to one of each of the quaternity, and the 5th being
  the Ego/self concept).  Then, the sixth produces the illusion of
  separate selves ... and does something importantly, awesomely crazy
  to represent harnessing the dangerously deadly and unpredictable Magic
  of Friendship directly.  Magical thinking always comes with a cost, so
  wield it carefully, and be wary of what can go wrong!


Idea:
-----
Exploring new ideas and concepts, that were never before seen or understood
before, as the intersection of existing ideas.

Such as, "green" + "run" + "danger".
[color] + [action] + [safety].

How would gameplay be related to this?  And what is the goal in relation to
a given idea?

To "understand" a given idea, draw some Tarot cards.  From each card, pick
some keywords, ideas, feelings, and notions related to those cards.

From this set of ideas, a world is generated to explore.  This world contains
resources to harvest, items to discover, or entities to interact with
(converse and trade with friendlies, avoid or combat with hostiles).
