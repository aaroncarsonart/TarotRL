My long term goals with this project:
=====================================
1. Complete Imbroglio classic.
2. Create AsciiTarotDeck.
    - An ASCII tile-based UI where you can use Tarot Cards.
    - Move and interact with cards.
    - Draw cards from the deck, and place them on the screen.
    - Flip cards to show the face or the back.
    - Be able to copy/paste text representation of a spread.
       - Nice to have: copy/paste RTF text with color and font

3. Complete TarotRL.
